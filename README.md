# Version Control LAB
Skills Lab 7: Plain text

_Ara Narayan and Alex Yarashevich Lab 7_

## Our program: 
Our program gets the input of a user's name and their age. 
Then the program prints "Your name is [the user's name] and are [user's age] years old!"

The program then prints a few empty lines (for aesthetic purposes) and then asks the user for their favorite book. Then we ask for the author of that book. 

Then the program prints "The book [user's favorite book] was written by [the author]" 

We also combine all the input that the user has entered in the program into a list and then display a sentence with everything that we have learned from our user
while using variables from the list.

It will look something like the this:
"Thank you for answering [name], it is interesting to know that [age] year olds are reading [book] by [author]."

## Why We Chose this License 
We chose the unlicense because it allows for all use (any user may use it, without restriction) and it includes liability and warrenty protection. At the same time, this lisence includes a statment that the program offers no gaurentees to people who might use it - protecting us should any issues arrise.
