# Version Control LAB
Skills Lab 7: Plain text

_Ara Narayan and Alex Yarashevich Lab 7_

## Our program: 
(Written for Lab 6)

Our program gets the input of a user's name and their age. 
Then the program prints "Your name is [the user's name] and are [user's age] years old!"

The program then prints a few empty lines (for aesthetic purposes) and then asks the user for their favorite book. Then we ask for the author of that book. 

Then the program prints "The book [user's favorite book] was written by [the author]" 

We also combine all the input that the user has entered in the program into a list and then display a sentence with everything that we have learned from our user
while using variables from the list.

It will look something like the this:
"Thank you for answering [name], it is interesting to know that [age] year olds are reading [book] by [author]."

(Added for Lab 7)

The program prints three more empty lines, and then prompts the user by asking "Do you have a favorite artist? (Y/N): ".

Then, using an if/else statement the program either asks who the artist is and prints "I see [the user's name]! You like the author [the author] and the artist [the artist's name]."

_Step 2: Make edits to the Markdown files that contain License and Code of Conduct_:  
Paste the license used (unlicense) and the code of conduct

_Step 3: Add and commit your changes to the GitHub Repository_:  
Open the terminal and navigate to the directory where your repository is cloned. Type git add . to add all of your changes to the staging area. Type git commit -m "Add Jupyter Notebook" to commit your changes with a message. 

_Step 4: Push changes to the GitHub Repository_:  
Type git push in your terminal or command prompt. Press enter.

## Why We Chose this License 
We chose the unlicense because it allows for all use (any user may use it, without restriction). At the same time, this lisence includes a statment that the program offers no gaurentees to people who might use it - protecting us should any issues arrise. While it does not include a liabity or warrenty, we felt our program did not require it.

## How We Wrote our Code of Conduct 
We used the basic premise of being kind as the most important portion of our code of conduct. We referenced the GitHub Event Code of Conduct (found here: https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-event-code-of-conduct) and the Contributor Covenant by Coraline Ehmke (found here: https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) when discovering the best way to word our premise. Being kind is the first step to a proper collaboration, and we wanted to emphasize this as part of our theoretical project.
