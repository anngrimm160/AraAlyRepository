Skills Lab 6: Version Control

_Ara Narayan and Aly's Lab 6_

Our program: 
Our program gets the input of a user's name and their age. 
Then the program prints "Your name is [the user's name] and are [user's age] years old!"

The program then prints a few empty lines (for aesthetic purposes) and then asks the user for their favorite book. Then we ask for the author of that book. 

Then the program prints "The book [user's favorite book] was written by [the author]"
