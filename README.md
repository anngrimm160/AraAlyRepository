# Version Control LAB
Skills Lab 7: Plain text

_Ara Narayan and Alex Yarashevich Lab 7_

## Our program: 
Our program gets the input of a user's name and their age. 
Then the program prints "Your name is [the user's name] and are [user's age] years old!"

The program then prints a few empty lines (for aesthetic purposes) and then asks the user for their favorite book. Then we ask for the author of that book. 

Then the program prints "The book [user's favorite book] was written by [the author]" 

We also combine all the input that the user has entered in the program into a list and then display a sentence with everything that we have learned from our user
while using variables from the list.

It will look something like the this:
"Thank you for answering [name], it is interesting to know that [age] year olds are reading [book] by [author]."
